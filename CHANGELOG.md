## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- **Milestone 1: Core prompt → playable game loop**
  - Two-column layout: left chat rail + right game preview panel
  - Text input with "Make My Game!" submit button (Enter key supported)
  - Voice input via Web Speech API (mic button, Chrome only)
  - Chat bubble history showing user prompts and AI responses
  - Thinking/loading state with animated emoji indicator
- **OpenAI-powered game config generation** (`lib/ai.ts`)
  - `gpt-4o-mini` with `json_object` response format
  - System prompt maps natural language description → `GameConfig` JSON
  - Picks hero emoji, enemy emoji, background color, title, and speed from prompt
  - Speed clamped to safe range (180–380 px/sec), jump force fixed at 580
  - Silent fallback to default dog/cat config on API error
- **Next.js API route** (`app/api/generate-game/route.ts`)
  - POST `/api/generate-game` accepts `{ prompt }`, returns `{ config: GameConfig }`
  - Returns 401/500 errors with human-readable messages
- **Phaser 3 endless runner** (`public/game.html`)
  - Standalone HTML, Phaser 3.70.0 loaded from CDN (no bundler)
  - Hero auto-runs; SPACE or tap/click to jump over enemies
  - Emoji characters rendered as canvas text (zero asset management)
  - Clouds, ground, score counter, title display
  - Game Over panel with score; any key or tap restarts
  - Receives `postMessage({ type: 'LOAD_CONFIG', config })` to hot-swap theme
  - Sandboxed in `<iframe sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin">`
- **Project scaffolding**
  - Next.js 15, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, OpenAI SDK
  - `dev.sh` wrapper script resolves mise-managed Node/pnpm paths for preview runner
  - `.claude/launch.json` configured for `preview_start` tool

### Architecture
- Prompt → `POST /api/generate-game` → OpenAI → `GameConfig` JSON → `postMessage` → Phaser iframe
- Inspired by `09-google-stitch-clone` two-column layout and API route patterns
